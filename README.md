# Automating IoT Platform Deployment on Azure with Ansible

In our modern world, IoT platforms are crucial for collecting, processing, and using data from different devices. Automation helps us make the deployment process easier and ensures things work in any environment. This article will show you how to use Ansible and Azure IoT Suite to automatically set up an IoT platform on Azure. By using code to define the platform's parts, you can control how everything is deployed.

### Let's explore some exciting and innovative use cases that you can achieve by automating the deployment of an IoT platform on Azure using Ansible.

### Use Case 1: Predictive Maintenance

You can use automation to predict when your IoT devices might need maintenance. By using Azure Machine Learning with Ansible, you can train computer models to look at sensor data and find signs that equipment might break. Ansible can also set up Azure services like Azure Machine Learning Workspace and Azure Functions, which make it easier to put these predictive maintenance plans into action.

### Use Case 2: Intelligent Energy Management

By automating the setup of an IoT platform, you can make energy use more efficient in different places. With Azure IoT Suite and Ansible, you can automatically install smart sensors and devices that keep track of and manage how much energy is being used in buildings, factories, and even whole cities. Ansible makes it easy to set up these devices, collect data from sensors, analyze it right away, and take actions to save energy. This helps save money and is good for the environment too.

### Use Case 3: Real-time Inventory Management

When you use Azure IoT Suite and Ansible together, you can make a good inventory system that works in real-time. You can put IoT devices with special scanners, like RFID or barcode scanners, to keep track of things. Then, Azure Stream Analytics can automatically process the data and help you see where things are moving in your inventory. Ansible can help set up the devices, the computer stuff in the background, and the programs that process the data. This makes sure everything runs smoothly and you can manage your inventory easily, no matter how big it gets.

### Use Case 4: Smart Agriculture

Automating the setup of smart farming systems using IoT technology is a game-changer for agriculture. By using Azure IoT Suite and Ansible, you can install IoT devices that keep an eye on key things like soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and more. With Ansible, it's a breeze to create irrigation systems that use Azure Functions and Logic Apps to control how much water plants get based on the data collected by these devices. This clever automation makes sure crops get the right amount of water at the perfect time, resulting in better harvests and smarter use of resources.

### Use Case 5: Personalized Retail Experiences

Automation and IoT have the power to change how we shop by creating personalized experiences. With Ansible and Azure IoT Suite, stores can use special devices to collect information about customers, like where they are, what they like, and how they shop. By utilizing Azure services like Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Logic Apps, you can analyze the data immediately and send customized special offers, suggestions, or messages to each customer. Ansible makes it easy to set up and manage these devices and services, so stores can give their customers one-of-a-kind shopping experiences that fit their tastes.

## Getting Started

Now that we have explored these exciting use cases, let's move on to the practical steps involved in automating the deployment of an IoT platform on Azure using Ansible.

### Prerequisites

To follow along, you need to have the following:

- Azure subscription
- Azure Account. If you don't have one, get a [free one](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Generate service principal and expose them as environment variables or store them as a file
- Install Ansible
- Install Azure dependencies package ansible[azure]
- Install azure.azcollection into your execution environment

Note: The code snippets use the Ansible modules from Microsoft's Azure collection. Within my git repo, you'll find custom roles I created which allows more flexibility when deploying these services.

### Step 0: Set The Following Environment Variables

```plaintext
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<service_principal_client_id>
AZURE_SECRET=<service_principal_password>
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<azure_subscription_id>
AZURE_TENANT=<azure_tenant_id>
```

### Step 1: Secure Device Endpoint Creation

To establish secure endpoints for devices to connect to the cloud, the first step is to automate the creation of these endpoints using Ansible. Leveraging Azure's IoT Suite capabilities, you can define the necessary configurations and utilize Ansible's Azure modules to provision the required resources such as IoT hubs, device registries, and security mechanisms.

```yaml
- name: Create IoT Hub
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_iot_hub:
    name: my-iot-hub
    resource_group: my-resource-group
    sku_tier: 'Free'
    sku_capacity: 1

- name: Create Device Registry
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_iothub_device:
    name: my-device-registry
    resource_group: my-resource-group
    state: present
```

### Step 2: Data Aggregation and Cleaning

After successfully connecting the devices, the next step is to aggregate the data in the cloud. Ansible can automate the provisioning of Azure services such as storage accounts and data lakes, facilitating efficient collection of device data. Additionally, Ansibleâ€™s flexibility allows you to incorporate data cleaning processes to ensure high-quality data for further analysis and processing.

```yaml
- name: Create Storage Account
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_storageaccount:
    name: my-storage-account
    resource_group: my-resource-group
    kind: StorageV2
    sku_tier: Standard
    sku_name: Standard_LRS

- name: Create Data Lake Store
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_datalakestore_account:
    name: my-data-lake
    resource_group: my-resource-group
```

###  3: Routing Data to Azure Stream Analytics

To perform real-time analytics on the IoT data, the deployment and configuration of Stream Analytics jobs using Azure Stream Analytics is essential. Ansible allows you to automate this process by defining input sources, output sinks, and query logic for the Stream Analytics job.

```yaml
- name: Create Input Source
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_streamanalyticsinput:
    name: my-input-source
    resource_group: my-resource-group
    input_type: IoTHub
    input_iothub_name: my-iot-hub
    input_iothub_consumer_group: my-consumer-group

- name: Create Output Sink
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_streamanalyticsoutput:
    name: my-output-sink
    resource_group: my-resource-group
    output_type: PowerBI
    output_powerbi_workspace: my-powerbi-workspace
    output_powerbi_dataset: my-powerbi-dataset

- name: Create Stream Analytics Job
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_streamanalyticsjob:
    name: my-stream-analytics-job
    resource_group: my-resource-group
    inputs:
      - my-input-source
    outputs:
      - my-output-sink
    query: |
      SELECT * INTO my-output-sink
      FROM my-input-source
```

### Step 4: Data Processing and Action

Once data starts coming into Azure Stream Analytics, you can use it to make smart decisions and take action. Ansible can help you set up and control other Azure services, like Azure Functions or Azure Logic Apps, which will process the data and send alerts or notifications when needed.

```yaml
- name: Create Azure Function
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_functionapp:
    name: my-azure-function
    resource_group: my-resource-group
    runtime: dotnet
    app_service_plan: my-app-service-plan

- name: Deploy Azure Function Code
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_functionappdeployment:
    name: my-azure-function
    resource_group: my-resource-group
    src_path: /path/to/function/code

- name: Create Logic App
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_logicapp:
    name: my-logic-app
    resource_group: my-resource-group
    state: present
    definition: /path/to/logic-app/workflow.json
```

By following these steps and leveraging the automation capabilities of Ansible, you can seamlessly deploy and configure an IoT platform on Azure. The provided code snippets demonstrate how Ansible can streamline the deployment process and enable you to achieve your automation goals effectively.
